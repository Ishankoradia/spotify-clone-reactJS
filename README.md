## Objective
Build a spotify clone or atleast a SPA of it and learn how to deploy it using firebase.

## Web app hosted link
https://spotify-clone-react-38362.web.app/

## Learning
Deployment using firebase is pretty straightforward. The documentation can be found here - https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/quickstart . While building the app I also learned about the concepts of Datalayer, reducer and context API in React JS. Datalayer is used to wrap our application and make data visible to all components. This becomes very helpful when we have many child and nested components because using props in this case would mean just passing data through many layers without actually accessing them until it has reached the last child component where the data was actually required in the first place.

## Technologies used
- React JS
- Firebase for hosting
- spotify-web-api-js client-side wrapper for making api calls to spotify web api. https://www.npmjs.com/package/spotify-web-api-js
- css
